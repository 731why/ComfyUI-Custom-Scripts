This will store the base64 encoded version of every input image in memory until it is removed from history
May need some kind of limit on this...

Requires an update to app.js to allow rendering of b64 images

around line 113ish (in function addDrawBackgroundHandler) replace:

img.src = "/view/" + src;

with 

img.src = src.startsWith("data:image") ? src : "/view/" + src;
